# Code Conventions > CSharp

## Language Conventions

By default, we look to [Microsoft's C# programming guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) as a guide before making a decision.

## Regions

In C#, as well as other languages, we like to provide the name of the region at the start and end. This goes a long way in orienting the reader.

```csharp
#region Private Properties

// ...

#endregion Private Properties
```

1. Private properties
2. Protected properties
3. Public properties
4. Constructor(s)
5. Public methods
6. Protected methods
7. Private methods
