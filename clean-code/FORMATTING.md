## Vertical Formatting

### General

### Ordering

## Horizontal Formatting

### General

Strive to maintain a 100 character width maximum per line (shorter is typically better). Ideally,
this would be enforced by an auto-formatter or linting tools, but lines that are hard to read due to
length can also be called out in code reviews.

### Team Rules

We value consistency across our projects. While we will always have disagreements about
conventions, all project teams should up hold conventions until the team has agreed to make a change.

Team members should strive to make their code indistinguishable. We could go as far as to say it is a
code smell if you can tell who authored a piece of code.

That said, these documents are in no way set in stone. Proposals to change our practices are welcomed
and very much expected.
