# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

### Pull Request Checklist
* Provide a clear description of the problem accompanied by your solution
* Descriptive comments
* Read code and try your best to follow established code conventions (ie. format, regions, etc...)
* Automated tests for new and/ or changed code paths
* Ensure Travis CI build related to your branch is passing

## General feedback and discussions?
Start a discussion on the project's [repository issue tracker example](https://github.com/AndcultureCode/AndcultureCode.CSharp.Extensions/issues).
